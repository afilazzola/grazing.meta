2. 



### Timeline

date    | task

Nov 14  | Begin reviewing papers and extracting data
Jan 28  | Complete data extraction from papers
Feb 11  | Complete preliminary analysis and set structure for MS
Feb 25 | Settle on analyses to be used and begin writing manuscript
March 11 | Complete first draft of MS and pass to co-authors
March 25 | Comments passed back on draft

### Literature Review - 1. Search


### Revise list
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
search1.1 <- read.csv("data/WOS-lit.csv")
search1.2 <- read.csv("data/WoSPart3-July_4_2018.csv")
net.difference <- anti_join(search1.2, search1.1, by = "DOI")
net.difference <- net.difference %>% select(Title, DOI) #to simplify for a look
nrow(net.difference) #count of number of differences from consecutive search

## 182 papers to be added by including revised terms
## Select those articles and join with other dataset
net.difference <- anti_join(search1.2, search1.1, by = "DOI")

updated.search <- rbind(search1.1, net.difference)

#write.csv(updated.search, "data/WOS-lit.updated.csv")
```
