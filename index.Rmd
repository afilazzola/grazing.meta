### Purpose

Conduct a meta-analysis of the literature testing the indirect effects of grazing on animal taxa's through the direct effects on the plant community. 

### Objectives

April 2 | Complete revisions and submit to journal


### Literature Review - 1. Search

#### Search Terms

A systematic literature search was conducted using Web of Science for all emperical research articles.  The review will include all studies globally. The intended purpose of this search is to capture all articles that have documented grazing either along a gradient (e.g. different frequencies or intensity) or presence/absence (e.g. excluded, ungrazed, or retired ranch lands). We condcuted two separate searches to capture studies that tested gradients and studies that compared grazing to ungrazed treatments. Duplicate articles between the searches were removed. We also intentionally excluded terms that  resulted in articles not relevant to the purpose of this study including: review, synthesis, policy, social, carbon, and fish. The search terms that used were: 

**Search A**
`graz* OR livestock` **AND**  `exclosure* OR exclusion OR exclude* OR ungrazed OR retire* OR fallow*`

**Search B**
`grazing intensity OR grazing gradient OR stocking rate OR rotation* grazing`


### Literature Review - 2. Sort

This steps includes a. checking for duplicating, b. reviewing each instance for relevancy, c. consistently identifying and documenting exclusion criteria. Outcomes include a list of publications to be used for synthesis, a library of pdfs, and a PRISMA report to ensure the worflow is transparent and reproducible. Papers were excluded with the following characteristics:

- Not emperical study (e.g. review, book chapter)
- Irrelevant categories (e.g. political science, law, sports tourism, art)

#### Reasons for exclusion
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
evidence <- read.csv("data//synthesisdata//evidence.csv")
### Identify studies that were excluded
excludes <- evidence %>% group_by(reason.simplified) %>% count(exclude) %>% filter(reason.simplified!="")
ggplot(excludes, aes(x=reason.simplified, y=n)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + coord_flip()

## frequency of study
year.rate <- evidence %>% group_by(Publication.Year) %>% summarize(n=length(Publication.Year))

ggplot(tail(year.rate,30)) + geom_bar(aes(x=Publication.Year, y=n), stat="identity") + ylab("number of published studies") +xlab("year published") +theme(text = element_text(size=16))
```


#### Prisma report

```{r}
## total number of papers found
nrow(evidence)

## number of papers found outside of WoS
other <- read.csv("data/synthesisdata//other.sources.csv")
nrow(other)

## number of articles excluded
excludes <- evidence %>% filter(exclude=="yes")
nrow(excludes)

## relevant papers
review <- evidence %>% filter(exclude!="yes")
nrow(review)

## papers for meta
datasets <- read.csv("data//binary.simplified.csv")
meta <- length(unique(datasets$uniqueID))
meta

prisma(found = 2989,
       found_other = 1,
       no_dupes = 2989,
       screened = 2989,
       screen_exclusions = 2675,
       full_text = 315,
       full_text_exclusions = 0,
       qualitative = 315, 
       quantitative = 216,
       width = 800, height = 800)
```


#### Patterns of GI Studies Globally
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=10}
require(ggmap)
###  Start with base map of world
mp <- NULL
mapWorld <- borders("world", colour="gray50", fill="gray50") # create a layer of borders
mp <- ggplot() +   mapWorld

## colorblind-friendly palette
cbPalette <- c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7","#000000")

meta <- read.csv("data//synthesisdata//evidence.csv")
meta <- meta %>% filter(lat != "") ## remove blanks for lat and lon
meta <- meta[!grepl(";", meta$lat),] ## remove multiple entries
meta$lat <- as.numeric(levels(meta$lat))[meta$lat] ## convert from factor to number
meta$lon <- as.numeric(levels(meta$lon))[meta$lon] ## convert from factor to number


## plot points on top
mp <- mp+ geom_point(data=meta , aes(x=lon, y=lat), size=2) 
mp

```


### 3. Synthesis

```{r}
data <- read.csv("data//binary.simplified.csv")
