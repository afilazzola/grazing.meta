Hi Dr. xxx

I'm a researcher at University of Alberta and working with a lab there to conduct a meta-analysis examining the multi-trophic effects of grazing. The project shares a lot of similarities with your paper in Journal XXX examining the effects of grazing on xxxx.

I would like to include your manuscript in our meta-analysis because it fits well with our research question. However, I was unable to extract the relevant data from your article. I am looking for the mean, standard error or deviation, and associated number of replicates. Do you have that data available and would you be willing to share it so that we can include it in the meta-analysis?

I would be happy to discuss further too.

Thanks!
Your name
